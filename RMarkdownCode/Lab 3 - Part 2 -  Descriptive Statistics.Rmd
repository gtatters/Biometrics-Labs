# Exercise 1: Descriptive statistics

Most descriptive statistics are calculated using the Analyze menu, followed by Descriptive Statistics, and the Descriptives, Frequencies, or Explore commands. When calculating descriptives for more complex designs, including more than one independent variable, you can also use the Compare Means/ Means or the Descriptive Statistics/ Crosstabs command which allow you to calculate descriptive statistics of subgroups.

It is always important to take a moment to think about the type of data you are using and what descriptive statistics will be most useful given the type. For numerical data, you typically report measures of central tendency and measures of variability. It is often useful to observe the frequency distributions or histograms of continuous distributions to note if they are normal or skewed. For categorical data you typically report the frequency or proportion of each value.

Descriptive Statistics:

Let’s begin by calculating descriptive statistics for some of the data in the Appendix D file.

§ Open appendixd.sav

§ Ensure that you are viewing the data labels (e.g. male, female) rather than the value labels (e.g. 1, 2). If the values are visible rather than the labels, click the appropriate button to change this.

§ In the Analyze menu, select Descriptive Statistics and then Descriptives.

§ Select each of the numerical variables – ADD score, IQ score, Grade in 9th grade English, and GPA
in 9th grade – and transfer them to the variables list by clicking the right arrow.

§ Click on the options button. Put check marks next to Mean, Std. deviation, Variance, and S.E. mean. Uncheck the rest. Note that you can change the display order of your table. If variable list is selected, the variables will be displayed in the order that you added them to the list in the previous window, which is OK for right now. Click Continue, and OK.

§ Double click the table so you can edit it. A formatting toolbar and “pivoting trays” window pops up. Note that the menu at the top of the output windows also changes. As was the case with graphs, SPSS has many options to edit statistics in tables as well. Let’s try some of them.

§ Close the pivoting trays window. Under the pivot menu, select Transpose Rows and Columns. Note the change in your table. However, as this is not the conventional way to display statistics, repeat this again to return to the original orientation.


Select Format, Table Looks. Scroll through the various options for changing the overall look of the table. Many of these contain too much distracting formatting. Select Academic, and click OK.

§ Now click on Format, Table properties. Take a moment to view all of the options in this dialog box. “General” allows you to specify the width of row and column labels. “Notes” allows you to choose numeric or alphabetic labels, and subscript or superscript as the position for those labels for use as footnotes. “Cell formats” allows you to change the font style and size, color, and the alignment. “Borders” allows you to add or remove borders around rows, columns, and cells. “Printing” allows you to select options such as rescaling tables to fit on paper.

§ Under Cell Formats, select “row labels” using the area dropdown menu. Change the text to size 10 and bold. Repeat this for the area “column labels”, and also set the column labels to align right. Then select the area “data” and change to size 10, but do not bold. After you have made these changes, click OK.

§ Highlight all of the data in your table (all of the numbers within your table), except for the N values. Right-click and select cell properties. Under format value, decrease the number of decimals to 2. Click OK.

§ Double click on the row label “Grade in 9th grade English class” and edit the text so it says “English grade” instead. Do the same for GPA in 9th grade so it says only “GPA”.
§ Highlight the word mean, and change its justification to centre so that it is positioned above both the statistic and the Std. Error value.
§ Check that your final table looks like this:


Frequencies:
Now, we’ll use the frequencies command to help us examine the distributions of the same continuous variables.
§ Select Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies.
§ Select ADD score, IQ score, Grade in 9th grade English, and GPA in 9th grade and transfer them to
the variables list by clicking the right arrow
§ Uncheck “display frequency tables”, as this is not useful for continuous numerical variables. Click OK on the message that pops up.


Click on Statistics. Under percentile values, select quartiles. Under central tendency, select mean, median and mode. Under dispersion, select std. deviation, variance, and SE mean. Then click continue.
§ Click on Charts, and select “histograms”, then click continue.
§ Click OK.
§ Have a look at the frequency table and the histograms that pop up. If necessary, transpose the frequency table so that the variables are presented in rows, and the statistics in columns.
§ Look at the distribution for English grade. This histogram triggers your memory and you realize that students received grades of A, B, C, D or F depending on their original numeric mark (e.g. students with marks between 80 and 100 received a grade of A). These letter grades were coded 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0 respectively. This means English grade would be more appropriately categorized as a categorical ordinal variable.
§ Click on variable view, and edit the English grade variable to incorporate this new information. Change the measure, and add the above information about the grades using value labels, as you learned in last lab.
§ As before, you can edit the tables or the graphs by double clicking on them. One difference we have seen between the Descriptives and Frequencies options is that descriptives only include mean for measures of central tendency, whereas Frequencies include the mean, median, and mode. Further, Descriptives does not have any built in graphing options, but Frequencies does.
Now let’s use Frequencies to describe categorical data.
§ Select Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies.
§ This time, put gender, repeated a grade, level of English class, Grade in English class, social problems, and drop out status in the variable list.
§ Select Display frequency table. Since there is a finite number of values for these variables, we want to know how many people fit in every category.
§ Click on Statistics and unselect all of the options. Then click Continue.
§ Next, click on Charts. Click on Bar chart and select Percentages as the Chart Values. Click
Continue and then Ok.
§ Take a moment to review the output.
§ Notice that the frequency tables include a column labeled Percent and another labeled Valid percent. This is an important distinction when you have missing cases. Valid percent is the percentage out of all the known cases, while percent is the percentage out of total cases. For example, imagine a sample of 100 students. Fifty cases are women, 40 are men, and 10 are

missing the data. The percent of men would be 40%, but the valid percent of men would be
44.4%.
§ Notice that the frequency table for grade in English class is organized from F to A. This is because F was assigned a value of 0, while A was assigned a value of 4.
§ Return to analyze, descriptive statistics, frequencies and select only Grade in 9th grade English. Click on Format. Select order by “descending values”. Click Continue then OK. Check that the table is now presented with the frequencies ordered from A to F.
Ø Go to Sakai and answer the question about the frequency data. Crosstabs:
Sometimes we need to know the number and percent of cases that fall in multiple categories. This is useful when we have multiple categorical variables in a data set. For example, in the data set we have been using, I’d like to know what percent of dropout and nondropout students had social problems. We’ll use crosstabs to calculate this.
§ Select Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Crosstabs.
§ Select social problems for Rows and dropped out for Columns.
§ Click on Cells and select Observed for Counts, and select Row, Column, and Total under Percentages. The click Continue.
§ Select Display clustered bar charts. Then, click Ok.
§ View the output. Edit the width of the chart columns so that the descriptions appear on one line
rather than spread over two. This makes the data easier to see.
§ Both the table and the graph show that of those youth with social problems, an equal number did and did not ultimately drop out of high school.
Explore:
Another useful tool for descriptive statistics is the explore option. It is often used to quickly screen a data set. It provides a variety of descriptive statistics for a numerical variable, including 95% confidence interval. It can be used for one numerical variable alone, or you can view the statistics for this variable according to another grouping/factor.
§ Select Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Explore.
§ Click on statistics and ensure that the confidence interval for the mean is set to 95%.
§ Click on plots. Check histogram, and uncheck stem and leaf if it is selected. Under boxplot, “factor levels together” should be selected.



 The numerical variable you are interested in must go under “dependent list”. Add IQ score to the
dependent list, and click OK.
§ Review the output. You should see a table of descriptive statistics, a histogram, and a box plot.
§ Now let’s view these statistics for IQ score based on gender. Select analyze, descriptive statistics, explore. Add IQ score to the dependent list, and gender to the factor list.
§ Review the output. You should see a table of descriptive statistics for IQ score for males and females separately. There will be separate histograms for males and females, and a box plot illustrating median, quartile data, and any extreme values for males and females.
Ø Go to Sakai and answer the next question. Compare Means:
Now, let’s consider another way to describe a continuous variable at different levels of a categorical variable. Let’s begin by comparing ADD symptoms for males and females.
§ Select Analyze/Compare Means/Means. Notice this is the first time we haven’t selected Descriptive Statistics.
§ Select ADD score for the Dependent List and Gender for the Independent List. Click Options. Notice that mean, number of cases and standard deviation are already selected under statistics. Look through the other statistics you can add. Add Standard error of the mean, then click continue and then Ok.
§ Review the output. It shows you the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean for ADD score, broken down by males and females.
Let’s try another more complicated example. This time, let’s compare statistics for ADD symptoms broken down by gender and whether or not a child had social problems.
§ Select Analyze/Compare Means/Means.
§ Just like before, select ADD score for the Dependent List, and gender for the Layer 1 Independent List. Then click Next. Select social problems as the Layer 2 Independent List. Select the same statistics under Options and then click Continue and Ok.
§ Review the output. Notice that this table gives you the ADD score statistics for gender independent of social problems under “total”, as well as the ADD score statistics for each gender with or without social problems.
§ Save the data file in case we want to return to it later.
Ø Go to Sakai and answer the question ADD scores.

Additional Practice
Caffeine in your coffee
The data in the file caffeine.xls shows the amount of caffeine in a 16-oz cup of coffee obtained from various vendors. Import this data into SPSS. For context, doses of caffeine over 25 mg are enough to increase anxiety in some people, and doses over 300 mg are enough to significantly increase heart rate in most people. Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine per serving. Analyze this data using the appropriate descriptive statistics function to view the mean amount of caffeine in a 16-oz coffee and the 95% confidence interval.
View the caffeine data in a histogram. Adjust the scale of the X-axis so it has a lower and upper margin of 0%, a minimum of 140, a maximum of 260, and a major increment of 20.
Now import the data contained in the file caffeine-starbucks.xls. This file has data on six 16 oz cups of coffee sampled on six different days from the same Starbucks location. Use SPSS to calculate the mean and standard error for these data.
Ø Answer the next three questions on Sakai. Hemoglobin levels
Import the data from Hemoglobin.xls into SPSS. This file contains data on blood hemoglobin level from three populations living at high-altitudes (Andes, Ethiopia, and Tibet) and a sea-level population from the USA. Use the appropriate command to view the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean for hemoglobin concentration (g/dL), according to population.
