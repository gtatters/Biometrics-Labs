## Biometrics Lab Tutorials

An introduction to R and biometrics for Brock University students.  These tutorials are designed (eventually) to accompany BIOL 3P96.  This site is currently a work in progress and not yet ready for deployment although you are welcome to test out examples and give feedback.  Translation of existing SPSS tutorials is still ongoing.

Although it is possible to run through the code on your own, the tutorials will accompany a course website (Sakai) and, thus questions and assessments will be performed elsewhere.

Click the clone button and download this site as a zip file, uncompress and store in a location you have read/write access.  All tutorials involve accessing data files and setting your working directory to where each tutorial is save locally.
