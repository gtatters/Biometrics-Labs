## Biometrics Lab Tutorials

An introduction to biometrics in R for Brock University students.  These tutorials are designed, eventually, to accompany BIOL 3P96.  This site is currently a work in progress and not yet ready for deployment.  

Although it is possible to run through the code on your own, the tutorials will accompany a course website (Sakai) and, thus questions and assessments will be performed elsewhere.

Click the clone button and download this site as a zip file, uncompress and store in a location you have read/write access.  All tutorials involve accessing data files and setting your working directory to where each tutorial is save locally.
